I am a Quantitative Analyst at [ING](https://www.ing.com). This is my academic webpage.

Before joining ING, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de) (MPI MiS) in the [Nonlinear Algebra group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nonlinear-algebra/) led by [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/).

Before moving to the MPI, I did my PhD studies at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Diane Maclagan](https://dmaclagan.warwick.ac.uk/).

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/en/), my advisor there was [Marco D'Anna](https://web.dmi.unict.it/docenti/marco.danna). I was also a student of the [Scuola Superiore di Catania](https://ssc.unict.it/).
