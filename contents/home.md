I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Mathematical Sciences. I'd be happy to make friends with you and discuss math together. You can reach me by Email or QQ.

#### Research Interests  
My current research interests lie in topics from discrete geometric and discrete analysis. There are five kinds of problems which I am particularly interested in:
 1. Problems guided by ideas from Riemannian geometry and global analysis.
 2. Problems concerned in graph theory or theoretical computer science which may be attacked by geometric analysis methods.
 3. (Harmonic; Nonlinear) analysis methods/results that can guide the investigation of new phenomena in discrete spaces.
 4. Discrete (geometry; analysis) methods/results that can guide the investigation of new phenomena in continuous spaces.
 5. Periodic Schrödinger operator and quasiperiodic Schrödinger operator on lattice.
